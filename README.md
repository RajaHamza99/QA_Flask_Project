# QACProject

-> Python3

-> Flask

-> SQL Alchemy

-> Selenium

-> Pytest

The Python Micro-Framework Flask is being utilised due to the high amount of integration with components to speed up development. for example SQLAlchemy Models and Flask_WTF Integration for validation and posting errors to the page using Jinja templating (HTML)

Python is seen to be a high level language and is incredibly versatile. many people know python because python does a lot of things!. 
As such further development or making this project opensource could see more collaboration than with other languages.

This Project will use the Feature-Branch Models as well as Test Driven Development. code test coverage must be over 90% to be merged with the development branch for further testing (using Pytest and Selenium)

There are other User Stories However they are mostly nice to have or more advances features

# First Sprint

As Seen within the Minimum Viable Product only one user story has been chosen for this sprint. This is due to the short sprint time of a day. 
As well as this is one of the more advances features as you can see from the below tasks:

This includes the full system integrated to the Flask Application, with included Integration and Unit Testing so we can continue to ensure it works throughout the project as smaller features are added
